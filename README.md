# TOS-4

ThakurOS version 0.4
Notes: (vx.4) - ThakurOS Live with Stock KDE & Calamares Installer

Project restarted with following new method of building ISO

Build with mkarchiso command (remember to be root). Also remember to point to directory in which this repo is extracted.  


NOTE: Thakur OS is undergoing alot of changes. The old-school way of doing things is evolving and starting to become accustomed to the new way things are going on at the moment. Part of this is due to the many changes happening within Arch. The new year is promising and however, would not be short of challenges.
